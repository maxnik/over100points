over100points
=============

View HackerNews stories with more than 100 points in chronological order

Go check it out: [maxnik.github.io/over100points](http://maxnik.github.io/over100points)

I used to browse HN through [news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100](http://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=100) link. You can have a quick look on what happened recently without browsing 
through a dozen pages. But I didn't like the ranking algorithm they used on 
that page. Sometimes stories from months and years ago bubbled up to the top, 
but recent ones were buried under the stuff that I already saw.

So I used the API from [www.hnsearch.com/api](https://www.hnsearch.com/api) 
to query only for the fresh items with more than 100 points.
